# Day 14 - Restroom Redoubt

> Written in Rust

This is an iteration algorithm that asks for the state of play after a certain number of iterations.
A series of objects in movement are presented as the input (along with a potential max height and
max width), and this program must find out their locations after a number of iterations.

The input we are given can be said to fit the following pattern on a per-line basis:

```regexp
p=[0-9]+,[0-9]+ v=-?[0-9]+,-?[0-9]+
```

Which describes the initial start position of an object, and its vector of movement in the format
of `[x,y]` for all number pairs.

In addition to all of that, if an object were to leave the boundary, they will wrap around to the
other side in continuous movement.

For example, here is what `p=2,4 v=2,-3` does for the first few seconds...

```text
Initial state:
...........
...........
...........
...........
..1........
...........
...........

After 1 second:
...........
....1......
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........

After 2 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
......1....
...........

After 3 seconds:
...........
...........
........1..
...........
...........
...........
...........

After 4 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
..........1

After 5 seconds:
...........
...........
...........
.1.........
...........
...........
...........
```

For a larger example:

```text
p=0,4 v=3,-3
p=6,3 v=-1,-3
p=10,3 v=-1,2
p=2,0 v=2,-1
p=0,0 v=1,3
p=3,0 v=-2,-2
p=7,6 v=-1,-3
p=3,0 v=-1,-2
p=9,3 v=2,3
p=7,3 v=-1,2
p=2,4 v=2,-3
p=9,5 v=-3,-3
```

Describes a series of objects and their velocities. Their initial positions can be plotted onto
a grid of `11,7` as follows:

```text
1.12.......
...........
...........
......11.11
1.1........
.........1.
.......1...
```

After 100 iterations, the grid would look like the following:

```text
......2..1.
...........
1..........
.11........
.....1.....
...12......
.1....1....
```

To score this grid, we take robots within each quadrant (excluding any robots that are on the line
between), and multiply their numbers together.

For the above, it becomes:

```text
..... 2..1.
..... .....
1.... .....
           
..... .....
...12 .....
.1... 1....
```

`1 * 4 * 3 * 1` to a total of `12`.

## Part two

Part two is now focused on searching for a Christmas tree within the input (which will only appear
wholly in one of the four quadrants).

While this solution does not provide a clear answer to the question in this regard, it does allow
for tuning and confirmation. By enabling debug logging and tweaking the `--iterations` flag, the
controller can find the iteration with the lowest apparent total score, then inspect that specific
iteration to confirm that the tree has been found.

## This script

This script uses Rust and can be run with the following command:

```shell
cargo run -- -i input.txt
```

The following additional flags can be set:
* `--max-width` - defaults to `11`
* `--max-height` - defaults to `7`
* `--iterations` - defaults to `100`

Debug logging can be enabled with `RUST_LOG=debug` as a command prefix.
