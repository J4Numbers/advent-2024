# Day 8 - Resonant Collinearity

> Written in GoLang

This is... a very confusingly explained vector mapping problem. The input file we are given
contains a map of different antennas emitting different frequencies. The file itself can be said
to fill the following assumptions:

* All lines are of the same length
* All lines are in the format `[0-9a-zA-Z.]`

Antennas which share a frequency can produce antinodes, which exist twice as far away from one
point as the other.

For example...

```text
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

The above map shows that frequency `a` has two antennas, which are `[1,-3]` distance away from each
other. The antinodes are where that difference is applied to the individual node either played
normally, or reversed.

The problem we want to solve is asking how many unique positions an antinode occupies in a map,
as many frequencies and antennas can then share a position.

In a more complete example, such as:

```text
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

The following are the mapped out antinodes (plus an overlapping antinode on the topmost `A`):

```text
......#....#
...#....0...
....#0....#.
..#....0....
....0....#..
.#....A.....
...#........
#......#....
........A...
.........A..
..........#.
..........#.
```

Which results in a total of `14` total unique locations that an antinode can appear within this
map.

## Part two

Part two states that new antinodes can appear at the same intervals as the original antinodes
(namely with the same difference vector).

For example...

```text
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

This means that the original example above becomes the following:

```text
##....#....#
.#.#....0...
..#.#0....#.
..##...0....
....0....#..
.#...#A....#
...#..#.....
#....#.#....
..#.....A...
....#....A..
.#........#.
...#......##
```

With `34` unique antinodes.

## This script

This script uses Go and can be run with the following command:

```shell
go run . -i input.txt
```

To enable part two, include the `--repeat` flag.
